<p class="tldr">TLDR: Summer internships are great, but most misunderstand why they exist. Communication, assertiveness, and tact are all necessary to have a successful internship. </p>

I’ve spent seven of my last eight summers working technology internships throughout Silicon Valley, at small and big, well known and boutique companies. My experience as an intern junkie has lead to a number of insights about how internships work, what companies expect from internships, and what it takes to succeed as an intern. Getting the most out of an internship can be tricky, in large part because most students misunderstand certain truths about the interning process. This post covers three such "myths" and explains how, given the truth of the matter, interns can set themselves up for success.

### Myth #1: Companies expect summer interns to write meaningful, production ready code.
If you go to a job fair or read HR marketing material, you may believe that companies rely on their interns to build mission critical features into technology products. This is, for the most part, a complete lie: __*companies rarely expect interns to get any meaningful or mission critical work done*__. And why would they? An intern is someone who has no prior relationship with the company and no long term commitment to them. This isn’t someone a smart company would give meaningful responsibility, regardless of what the company’s HR marketing materials say.

The primary reason companies have intern programs, by a wide margin, is to introduce potential full-time recruits to the company. This is helpful on both ends – it gives the company a chance to get to know you and gives you a chance to know the company. A second reason is to promote the company brand from a broader hiring perspective (interns from good schools have smart friends), even if they don’t hire you directly. In distant third is the small chance that an intern will produce usable, production quality code.

The painful result of these diminished expectations is that they create a self-fulfilling prophecy. When an intern isn’t working on something mission critical and resources are constrained, she is counting on the benevolence of her mentor to get face time and attention. This can be very difficult if the intern’s mentor is busy (often the case) or simply uninterested in nurturing a student during ¼ of each year (occasionally the case). The burden is on you as the intern to be assertive enough to overcome these expectations and produce something meaningful.

###Myth #2: A summer intern will enter with a well defined, correctly scoped project that requires no revising.
Most internships involve a nominal description of a project before the internship starts. These project ideas are usually the result of __*a few minutes of thought*__ on the part of the hosting company – not a rigorous analysis of what is in the mutual interest of the intern and the company or realistic given the time frame and the intern’s capabilities.

Within your first few days, actively start a conversation about the goals and scope of your summer work and keep this going throughout the summer. Be unabashedly candid about your existing expertise and where you need help. Be assertive about your interests and what help you need from them to accomplish the plan you’ve set out. There are a number of common pitfalls in project selection which your host may not have considered: 

<div class="normal_lists" markdown='1'>
* _Projects which require too much bootstrapping_ -- these will leave you getting up to speed the entire 3 months and never accomplishing anything.
* _Projects in which the intern will (a) learn nothing new or (b) will only learn new things_ -- these fail to strike the correct balance between an intern's skill-set and interests.
* _Projects where there is no clear hand-off of the intern's work_ -- 90% of intern projects are abandoned once the intern leaves because there is no clear follow-up story.
</div>

Do not hesitate to redefine your project a few weeks into the internship, especially if you think one of the above pitfalls applies. Course correcting demonstrates that you are thoughtful and want to have a successful summer and also that you are assertive enough to point out potential problems.

###Myth #3: An intern can expect her mentor to dedicate substantial time to mentoring without being asked.
The perfect intern mentor is a technical genius who is working on extremely interesting project and has plenty of time to spend mentoring an intern. This person doesn't exist -- talented engineers are busy! Hosts can also vary in terms of their enthusiasm for a temporary apprentice. The worst ones take advantage of or entirely neglect their interns, but most are genuinely good people who have competing priorities.

Having a successful internship hinges on working successfully with your mentor, whatever their expertise or enthusiasm about having an intern. Get a read on your mentor early on and figure out how much time she is going to devote to helping you. If it seems like very little, focus on finding other resources within the immediate group who you can rely on – and explicitly ask your mentor of these exist (of course, in deference to their busy schedule!).

Finally, __*do not be afraid to ask questions*__. Getting started in new engineering organization is difficult and time consuming. As an intern, you have at most a few weeks to get up and running on a new codebase, lest you risk wasting your entire summer getting code to compile. Most interns avoid asking questions and stumble around through poor documentation, obfuscated build processes, and crufty code without asking enough questions. Don’t waste too much time getting oriented -- ask questions of your mentor, peers, or anyone else that will listen!

###In Summary
Most companies expect very little from interns. As a result, if you want to accomplish more than _very little_, you'll need to actively manage your own summer and swiftly navigate your new organization, team, and product. Doing so successfully can yield huge returns.
